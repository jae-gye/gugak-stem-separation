## Plan & tracking — Notion is the single source of truth
- **Fetch at session start, and before any planning/status discussion:** Notion page
  **Gugak Stem Separation** — id `3a4cb377-8743-8136-8f9a-c2bc24ef8269`
  (https://app.notion.com/p/3a4cb377874381368f9ac2bc24ef8269).

- **On any conflict, Notion wins** — it's the newer, authoritative plan. Trust Notion for
  anything plan-shaped; trust this file for stable facts/conventions.

## sym8 power-off — 2026-08-01 (routine, ~1 day)
Building maintenance during summer break: sym8 loses power ~1 day on 2026-08-01, back same
day or next. **Disks survive — NOT a decommission.** No backups/evacuation needed; `data/`,
wandb offline runs, and the uv env persist. Only ask: leave things clean and resumable —
no jobs mid-flight, work committed + pushed. Remove this block once passed.

## Environment
- `uv` project, Python 3.11. `ffmpeg` = system dependency (server-provided), not a Python dep.
- PyTorch cu128 via the PyTorch index (uv), pinned in `pyproject.toml`.
  **GPU (confirmed 2026-07-19):** sym8 driver 590.48 (CUDA 13.1) → cu128 build (sm_120).
- **Audio I/O: `soundfile`** (handles float wavs; stdlib `wave` chokes on them).
  **Avoid `librosa`** — lab convention.

## Datasets  (full status → `docs/dataset_status.md`; taxonomy → `docs/stem_taxonomy.md` +
canonical mapping `configs/stem_taxonomy.yaml`; counts/tables → Notion)
- Refer to sets as **ensemble dataset** / **solo dataset**, not their idx.
- **71955 (ensemble, ours-for-everything):** 903 songs with audio (published 1,004 minus
  101 withheld-test songs); 1 master + N stems each; 6,670 WAVs. 48 kHz/24-bit/stereo,
  except 130 files at 96 kHz (창작국악 → resampled).
- **71470 (solo phrases, train-only pool):** ~9,945 usable single-instrument clips +
  per-clip MIDI (악보) and annotations. Format-heterogeneous — 15 (sr, bit, ch) combos incl.
  float wavs, clips ~1–78 s → resampled + unified on ingest.
- **On disk:** `data/` holds one symlink per set:
  - `data/gugak_ensemble_71955/` → `~/storage/nia-gugak` — `source/<song>/` =
    `<song>_master.wav` + `<song>_<instrument>.wav`; tagging JSONs in `labels/`.
  - `data/gugak_solo_71470/` → `~/storage/ngc-gugak` — flat `audio/` · `midi/` · `labels/`.
- **Manifests = source of truth** (never walk directories). Layout: every table =
  `manifests/parquet/<name>.parquet` (canonical, committed) + `manifests/csv/<name>.csv`
  (eyeball twin, mostly gitignored). Writers derive both from one basename via
  `table_paths()`. Tables:
  - `eval_manifest` — frozen 71955 song-level split (`src/data/data_splitter.py`).
  - `ingest_manifest` — one row per ingested file: provenance + ops (`src/data/ingest.py`).
  - `audio_qc*` — QC scans: `audio_qc` = raw sources, `audio_qc_ingest_<set>` = processed
    store (`scripts/audio_qc.py`). `audio_qc.parquet` is the channel-decision table ingest
    consumes.
  - **`source_manifest` = the one dataloaders read** — ingest ⋈ QC ⋈ taxonomy, one row per
    ingested source file, keyed by stable `file_id` (`src/data/build_source_manifest.py`).
    The pitch-shift pool will be a SEPARATE table at (source × semitone) grain,
    foreign-keying here — must not re-copy split/instrument/content columns.
  - `activity_index` · `activity_segments` · `activity_summary` · `chunk_activities` —
    stem activity scan outputs (`src/data/activity_scan.py` stage 1 →
    `src/data/build_activity_manifest.py` stage 2); envelope blob gitignored at
    `data/activity/`.
- **Split principle** (publisher's split CSVs/folders inconsistent & incomplete — ignored):
  own song-level split, stratified by genreSub, seed-pinned, no song crossing splits.
  Test + val are frozen 71955 song lists; the training side is generated augmented mixes,
  not a song-count split. Ratios/counts + augmentation design → Notion.

### Key facts & gotchas
- **Vocals:** 71955 has no vocal/소리 stem anywhere (incl. 판소리 — its masters also appear
  voiceless). 71470 does supply clean solo vocal clips → whether the scheme gains a voice
  class is a live decision → Notion. Do not assume "no voice stem" as settled.
- **master ≠ Σ(stems) (verified, Phase 2).** Publisher master is mastered (per-stem faders
  + reverb/FX) and genre-dependent (민요 ≈ clean sum, 창작국악 heavily processed).
  → never invert master → stems; stem targets don't sum to it. Training mixtures are
  generated augmented mixes → Notion (Training Data Strategy).
- **Two variants per eval song:** publisher master + Σstem mix. **Early stopping and
  monitoring on the Σstem variant only** — master-val carries an irreducible error floor
  (the mastering residual) that muddies curves/early-stop. Master-val = real-world
  reference, never model selection. Rationale → Notion.
- **Audio QC — raw scanned 2026-07-25, processed store verified 2026-07-27**
  (`scripts/audio_qc.py` → `manifests/parquet/audio_qc*.parquet`; findings → Notion). Ingest
  verification: 16,615/16,615 files at 44.1k/PCM_24, 0 peaks >1.0, 0 dead, 0 anti-phase or
  dual-mono survivors, duration conserved 465.38 h. Standing rules:
  - **Sparse ≠ dead** — do NOT auto-drop low-activity stems (박 etc. play rarely by design).
  - Normalize the mixture, never per-stem (loudness ~−19 LUFS in 71955).
  - 71470 ingest: clamp/normalize peaks >1.0, DC-remove, and never naive-average L/R to
    mono (anti-phase clips cancel) — one channel or phase-aware downmix.
- **판소리 length-align (verified, Phase 2):** stems start-aligned; in 28 판소리 songs one
  stem (almost always 가야금) runs longer than the master (usually <0.5 s, one 11 s tail)
  with real content the master lacks. Rule: **trim every stem to the shortest per song
  before summing** (never pad — padding injects content the master never had). 판소리-only.
- **Multi-instrument stems** (피리1/피리2/피리3…) → strip trailing digit to base, sum
  same-base into one source.
- **Korean filenames need NFC** normalization for any name join. Master naming translation:
  on disk `<song>_master.wav` vs metadata records `<song>.wav`.

## Repo conventions
- **Experiment configs:** one per experiment (`configs/*.yaml`) = one wandb run; change
  configs, not code, for hyperparameter variation. Shared/cross-experiment configs
  (e.g. `configs/stem_taxonomy.yaml`) also live in `configs/`; split
  `configs/experiments/` vs `configs/shared/` if it grows.
- **Run naming:** `expNNN_<model>_<stemscheme>_<key-hparam>`
  (e.g. `exp003_bsroformer_4stem_lr1e-5`).
- **Experiment folders** (`experiments/`): numbered = `exp<NNN>_<YYMMDD>_<rest>`
  (e.g. `exp001_260722_htdemucs_4stem`); named one-offs = `<YYMMDD>_<name>`
  (e.g. `260719_zeroshot_baseline`). Track metrics (parquet/md); figures gitignored
  (regenerable from tracked metrics + script).
- Log git commit hash + full config to wandb for every run.
- Split frozen in the manifest; never let chunks of one song cross splits (audio leakage).
- Notebooks (`notebooks/`) = EDA only.

## Modeling tooling
- **MSST-first:** wrap ZFTurbo/Music-Source-Separation-Training. Config-driven HTDemucs,
  BS-RoFormer, Mel-Band RoFormer, SCNet; **fine-tune from pretrained** (~370 h ensemble
  stems + ~40 h solo clips = fine-tuning territory). Don't reimplement what MSST provides.
- **Custom later:** `src/models/` for gugak-specific ideas + ablations.
- Experiment order, stem-class scheme, model roadmap = live decisions → Notion.

## Evaluation & logging
Full protocol + wandb design → Notion (Evaluation & Logging). Always-on rules:
- Training metric: SI-SDR (fast). Reported: museval-style chunked SDR (literature-comparable).
- Always break results down **per-stem AND per-genre**, never global mean only.
- Val monitoring/early stopping on the **Σstem variant** (see gotchas).
- Expect lower SDR than Western benchmarks (heterophony → high source overlap).
  Quantify, don't panic.
